# TestPublic

Trying to impliment AutoTag from Actions

## Test added

Testing bump code by sending a new push request.

## Result

First test was successful and a tag with v1.0.1 was created, but I was thinking may be tag v1.0.0 should be the appropriate one.

## Test - 2

Now testing to see if the tag gets bumped automatically to v1.0.2 by sending a new push request.
